            Vegetable, in the broadest sense, any kind of plant life or plant product, namely “vegetable matter” in common, narrow usage, the term vegetable usually refers to the fresh edible portions of certain herbaceous plants—roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruit, or seeds. 
            These plant parts are either eaten fresh or prepared in a number of ways, usually as a savory, rather than sweet, dish.

            Non-vegetarian food (in Indian English sometimes shortened to non-veg food[1]) contains meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, or the flesh of any other animal), and sometimes, eggs. The term is common in India, but not usual elsewhere.
            In the generally vegetarian environment of India, restaurants offering meat and fish usually have a "non-vegetarian" section of their menu, and may include the term (typically as "Veg and Non-veg") in their name-boards and advertising. 
            When describing people, non-vegetarians eat meat and/or eggs, as opposed to vegetarians.[2][3][4] But in India, consumption of dairy foods is usual for both groups.

            <p class="card-text">Ice cream, frozen dairy food and common dessert made from cream or butterfat, milk, sugar, and flavourings. Frozen custard and French-type ice creams also contain eggs. Containing less air than the ice cream produced in the United States (which has more butterfat), and denser and more intensely flavoured, is the related Italian gelato. 
              Hundreds of flavours of ice cream have been devised, the most popular being vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. (When the three flavors are combined, it is known as Neopolitan.) Ice cream is also the basis of other desserts, such as baked Alaska, which consists of ice cream layered between a slice of sponge cake and a covering of meringue that is browned in either an oven at high heat or by a butane culinary torch.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Fruit Juice</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Juice is a drink made from the extraction or pressing of the natural liquid contained in fruit and vegetables. It can also refer to liquids that are flavored with concentrate or other biological food sources, such as meat or seafood, such as clam juice. 
              Juice is commonly consumed as a beverage or used as an ingredient or flavoring in foods or other beverages, such as smoothies. Juice emerged as a popular beverage choice after the development of pasteurization methods enabled its preservation without using fermentation (which is used in wine production). The largest fruit juice consumers are New Zealand (nearly a cup, or 8 ounces, each day) and Colombia (more than three quarters of a cup each day). 
              Fruit juice consumption on average increases with a country's income level.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Sweets</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Mithai (sweets) are the confectionery and desserts of the Indian subcontinent. Thousands of dedicated shops in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka sell nothing but sweets.
              Sugarcane has been grown in the Indian subcontinent for thousands of years, and the art of refining sugar was invented there 8000 years ago (6000 BCE) by the Indus Valley civilisation.
               The English word "sugar" comes from a Sanskrit word sharkara for refined sugar, while the word "candy" comes from Sanskrit word khaanda for the unrefined sugar one of the simplest raw forms of sweet.
                Over its long history, cuisines of the Indian subcontinent developed a diverse array of sweets. Some[5] claim there is no other region in the world where sweets are so varied, so numerous, or so invested with meaning as the Indian subcontinent.</p>
